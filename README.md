Stratasys Reprap Project
Repurposing and rebuilding 3D printers made by stratasys "Strat-a-trap"

This will cover various models, mainly the ones that are old enough to get for free, however these printers are very similar in design.

exhausted, they will be replaced
with the GT®3 equivalent. GT®3
belts will not be avilable until
GT®2 belts are depleted

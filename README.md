Azteeg X5 mini 32BIT All-in-one Controller V1.1 - Pin Terminals

The X5 mini is a 32 bit ARM based Motion controller for 3D printers, CNC Machines and Laser cutters. The X5 mini runs on Smoothieware firmware and is based on Smoothieboard by the awesome Arthur Wolf. The X5 mini uses the powerful 32bit, 120Mhz NXP LPC1769 ARM chip capable of faster calculations for faster and smoother movements without breaking a sweat. 

Configuration is easier using a text based config file loaded on the SD card, no need to upload firmware every time you make a change.     Just edit the config file from your PC then reboot the board with the new config and you're done.

Compact and powerful all in one solution. Board size: 3.4"(94mm) X 2"(50mm)

Stratasys Reprap Project
Repurposing and rebuilding 3D printers made by stratasys "Strat-a-trap"

This will cover various models, mainly the ones that are old enough to get for free, however these printers are very similar in design.


Dimension 1200 SST

Gantry 254 x 254 x 305 mm (10 x 10 x 12 in) - Useable space with dual extrusion 
Layer Height .254 mm (.010 in) or .330 mm (.013 in) - Stock

Printer Size & Weight 838 x 737 x 1143 mm (33 x 29 x 45 in) 148 kg (326 lbs)
Dimension’s build chamber and extrusion-head tip get very hot! The chamber and head tip reach
temperatures of approximately 75° C (167° F) and 300° C (572° F) respectively.



Motors
12mm Belt
16mm Linear Rods

X (motor 16 tooth pulley) - (60 tooth pulley)
Y (20 tooth pulley) to (ideler pulley)
Z (36 tooth pulley) to (36 tooth) to (big lead screw pitch unknown)

Electronics
2x 120v DC 400 Watt (B075 CAT NO. FS2001G102) - Build Chamber Heaters one on each side
4x 24V .48A Radial Blower Fans (blows air through the heating elements)
1x 24V Radial Blower Fan (blows cooler air on the print head via a tube that runs down to the bottom of the printers case)

Motion

Standing at the front of the printer.
X asix moves right in the positive direction
Y axis moves away from you to the back of the printer in the negative direction
Z asix moves up in the positive direction
